very f2p, I'm asian (from the Philippines) i barely interact with most Filipino people
mainly because most of them are cringe /gen
i wouldn't mind INTS with them though (just please be normal)
minors can interact with me, but heads up I'm not the safest person to be around with if your a minor (i say the most out of pocket shit ever), if you are a minor do refrain from flirting with me (it's weird.),
if your 18+ i really don't mind flirting,
i am apart of the LGBTQIA+ (Bisexual), i respect the community and if you don't, please DNI. (or just atleast be a decent person and don't say disrespectful shit)
i do not support any type of transphobic jokes.
i am very sensitive about that topic (my special person is trans.)
if you do not respect that, kindly DNI.
I'm fine with jokes about anything, just make sure it stays as a joke.
you can vent to me whenever you'd like (heads up: I'm not the best at comforting and giving advice, but I'm willing to listen)

to the people i am not close with:
do not joke about transphobia/homophobia to me (you'll just piss me the fuck off)
i will somehow change personality when i get close to you
(i am usually chill around ppl and match their vibes, but once I'm comfortable i become a little quirky/hj)
i do say very random stuff and joke about stuff, if you are uncomfortable please do say so, i will shut the fuck up.
